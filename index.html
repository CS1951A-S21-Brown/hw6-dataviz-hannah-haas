    <h2 style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px"> Written Questions </h2>

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      <strong> 1. Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented. You don't
      have to address every question directly, but should at a high level address
      the main questions. (10 points) </strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      My dashboard effectively answers all of the questions presented. My first
      graph is a bar graph. The x axis is the different genres and then the y
      axis is the number of titles (movies/tv shows). Therefore, it clearly shows
      the number of titles per genre on Netflix. My second graph is a line graph.
      The x axis is the year and the y axis is the average runtime of movies.
      This graph shows the average runtime of movies by release year over time.
      My third graph is a flow chart, specifically a network graph. Each node in
      the graph represents an actor. Specifically, it is a popular actor - one
      that has been in at least 6 movies. Each link between the nodes represents
      a movie that both connecting nodes have acted in. Additionally, this graph
      is broken down by rating. On default, it only shows the connections between
      actors in R rated movies. Additionally, the user has the choice of ratings
      R, PG-13, PG, G, and NR. I decided to limit it by ratings and also to popular
      actors to de-clutter the graph and to make the information more relevant.
      With showing all ratings together there are a lot of separate clusters because
      the actors don't cross ratings a lot - therefore by showing it broken down
      by ratings, you get more meaningful information. Therefore, this graph is
      easily able to show information about the casts and answer question #3.

      <strong> 2. List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your
        visualization (6 points) </strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      D3 was definitely helpful and improved my visualization for a variety of
      reasons. Firstly, it is incredibly easy to use to make simple graphs. You
      simply have to compile the data and pass them in according to the D3
      documentation. Secondly, there is a lot of built in functionality that
      you do not need to worry about. Typically, making a flow type graph would
      be incredibly difficult and time consuming. However, with D3, you simply
      provide the nodes and links and it produces the graph on the backend.
      Finally, it offers a lot of personalization for simple graphs. You can
      add colors, axis, lables, tooltips, and more. This enables users to make
      beautiful graphs!

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      <strong> 3. List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating
        a visualization (6 points) </strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
       Despite the many benefits to D3 as I listed above, there are also some
       downsides to D3. Firstly, some of the documentation is uncompleted or
       confusing. Initially, I was planning on creating a Map graph for the
       Netflix dataset, however the documentation was confusing, assumed a lot
       of knowledge, and after a while I gave up. With this ineffective documentation,
       it's not always the best tool for creating visualizations. Secondly, I
       found D3 to be quite slow sometimes, particularily with my flow graph.
       While some of this may have been from my lack of efficiency, I researched
       and discovered that D3 is approx 70+ KB and therefore causes websites to
       load slower. Therefore, if speed is important, D3 might not be the best
       tool. Finally, it is a lot more complex and difficult to use for non-simple
       graphs. On the documentation there is pretty much no explanation on how
       to use D3 so I felt that it was very much look at the D3 documentation
       examples and the lab examples and try substitute your information to get
       it to work. Therefore, I sometimes felt that working with D3 is like trial
       and error. While this worked for the more trivial graphs, for more complex
       graphs I felt like the learning curve was very high.

    <h2 style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px"> Accessible Data Visualization </h2>


    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      <strong> Evaluate the accessibility of your dashboard based on the readings in the
      “Before you begin” section. What kinds of users might find this dashboard
       accessible and who might have more difficulty? What additional actions
       might you take to make this dashboard more accessible to all audiences?
       Your response should refer to at least one of the readings and be about
       1 paragraph. </strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      Based on the readings, my evaluation of the accessibility of my dashboard
      is quite poor. From the Medium reading, a lot of their points made don't
      apply to my dashboard - I don't use sound, color to distinguish points,
      animations, metaphors or symbols. Therefore, my dashboard isn't
      inaccessible for these reasons. My dashboard is, however, not fully
      accessible to individuals with a visual impairment. While my dashboard does
      use SVG and there is a better experience for screen readers (as explained
      in the Betterment article), there are several actions I could take to make
      it less difficult. I could provide a summary for each of my graphs that is
      readable by screen reader, enabling individuals to get a quick understanding
      of the data. Secondly, I could provide the raw data that I use in my graphs.
      To do this, I  could write to csv files when I calculate the data for my
      graphs and then link the files on my website. These actions would make my
      dashboard more accessible to blind individuals and individuals with visual
      impairments.

      <strong> Reflect on the stages of your design and implementation process when you
      could have taken steps to make your dashboard more accessible to all
      audiences. What are some factors that kept you from taking these steps?
      (a few sentences) </strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px">
      When initially designing my dashboard I chose the graphs that made the
      most sense for the data and so that I could sufficiently complete the
      project objectives. Therefore, I chose a flow chart with a hoverable
      element. This is very inaccessible and therefore in the design process I
      could have taken steps to think of a better graph type to convey the
      same information. However, the factor of that it is required to have a
      hoverable element for the assignment kept me from being able to make this
      part accessible. Furthermore, in the implementation stage I could have
      taken the steps to include csv files with the graph's data and added
      graph summaries. Some of the factors that preventing me from taking these
      steps are laziness, time constraints, and lack of necessity. These are all
      terrible factors, but as a busy college student I felt that I didn't have
      the time to spend to make it as accessible as I could. However, in a non
      college setting, I think that I would try to prioritize accessibility and make
      time for it, and in that sense I don't think there are any valid factors
      that would prevent me from taking the steps.
